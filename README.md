#### Learning a new language effectively
Learning a new language can be challenging, especially if you don't have much time. To tackle this, we can use the [ELM](https://github.com/mohanadwalo/effective-learning-methods) framework by listing as many as possible use cases and preparing conversations for them.

Let's apply the ELM framework steps

### ELM Flowchart

**1. Goal**

  Our goal is to learn a new language


**2. Acquire Basic Knowledge**

  - Learn the alphabet of the language
      
    This will help reading and pronouncing words correctly.

  - Learn the basic grammar
      
    This will help us form sentences correctly and build conversations.

  - Learn Very few basic words

    This will help us form sentences later.
  
Give yourself a few days to absorb as much relevant information as possible.
Make sure not to waste time on useless resources.

**3. Summary**

Based on the knowledge acquired in step 2, you should be able to have the following:

  - Grammar sheets or other grammar references
  - Electronic or physical dictionaries

**4. Use case list**

[ELM](https://github.com/mohanadwalo/effective-learning-methods) distinguishes between two different use case types, 

  - Comprehensive use case list
  - Unlimited use case list

Learning a new language is of type unlimited use case list, meaning there are countless use cases.

Example:
Based on the ELM framework mentioned earlier, we can list a category called “Apply for an official document at the city hall” and outline the following use cases:

  - Getting a birth certificate conversation (use case)
  - Getting a local tax certificate conversation(use case)

  
  First, start by learning all the vocabulary required in this context, then start practicing conversations by pretending to be in a real situation.

  Second, list all the expected questions you might need to answer.

Things you might ask:

```

- Where can I apply for a birth certificate?
- How much the application fee?
- What documents are required for the application?
- How long does it take to process the request?
- Where exactly should I apply (e.g., which window, floor, or office)?
...

```

Things you might need to answer:

```

- Have you already obtained the application form?
- Were you born in this city?
- Do you currently reside here?
- Have you completed the application form?
- Is the birth certificate for yourself or a family member?
- Could you please provide your ID card?
...

```



The more use cases you work on, the more progress you will make in learning a new language.

**5. Project**

    The project is optional and we will skip it because our use cases are practical enough.

**6. Improvements & Suggestions**

In addition to the use case framework, we can incorporate complementary methods:

    Watching short cartoon movies: Cartoons often use simple yet important vocabulary, making them ideal for beginners.

    Repeating the same movie multiple times: This helps reinforce language patterns and vocabulary.

    Connecting words with places: Pay attention to vocabulary on signs, posters, and other visual aids in places like train stations or streets. This association helps reinforce and recall the words every time you encounter them, making them easier to remember.
